TODO

 - plot measures (e.g. the radius, diameter) as a function of corpus size.
   Conjecture: they may decrease to a certain point, and then increase
   (increasing is the standard behaviour I guess).
   If this is the case then this will mark an "ideal" corpus size
   in some sense. What can this size tell us?
